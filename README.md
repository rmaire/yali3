# Yali

Yali (Yet another Logo implementation) is a programming language aiming at learning and exploring. It's primary goals are:

- Simplicity. Should be easy to type and read  
- Embedded in a graphic environment  

No goals are:

- Engineering features. Yali does not provide much features to build large, modular applications.  
- Speed (maybe later)  


## Building

```
    mvn compile
    mvn test
    mvn install -DgroupId=ch.uprisesoft -Dversion=0.1.3 -DartifactId=yali
```
